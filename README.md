Some restaurant owners are reluctant to get started with online food ordering. It can seem like a complex and time-consuming process to put in place or difficult to maintain.
So they either give up or completely outsource this part. But then the entire setups becomes inflexible or too expensive. Other solutions are less reliable or miss too many features. Feels like there’s no easy way.

So we took it upon ourselves to talk with restaurant owners like you and see what they needed. How does online food ordering system work in their favor? The rules of the game were universal common sense:

It shouldn’t eat away the restaurant’s profits;
It needs to be set up easily, by non-technical people who cook yummy dishes, not software programs;
It should be low-maintenance;
Most of all, it should work for business owners and food lovers alike and make the latter come back soon.
And that’s exactly what we did and more. In fact, we understood that restaurants needed something reliable that will help them grow. And we made it so affordable that it’s actually free, which means it costs you a lot more not to use it.
